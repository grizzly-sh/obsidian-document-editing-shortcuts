# Obsidian Document Editing Shortcuts

This plugin tries to take basic document editing shortcuts as well as advanced IDE's and implenents those in obsidian.

A lot of work and free time has gone into making this plugin as polished as possible, although there's still a ton of shortcuts and features to add, you can find them later in the README.

## Shortcuts

All shortcuts will **repeat** if you hold the buttons you mapped to perform them.
Here's what's completed and needs to be done
