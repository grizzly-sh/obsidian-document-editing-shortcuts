# Obsidian Document Editing Shortcuts

This plugin tries to take basic document editing shortcuts as well as advanced IDE's and implements those in Obsidian.

A lot of work and free time has gone into making this plugin as polished as possible, although there's still a ton of shortcuts and features to add, you can find them later in the README.

## Shortcuts

All shortcuts will `repeat` if you hold the buttons you mapped to perform them.
Here's what's completed and needs to be done

### Done
* [x] Navigate one character right and left
* [x] Navigate one word right and left
* [x] Delete one character right and left
* [x] Delete one word right and left
* [x] Navigate up and down
* [x] Add new line (Enter)
* [x] Start new line (this creates a new line below the cursor and navigates there without splitting)

### Todo
* [ ] Navigate up down left right with selection
* [ ] Navigate one word left and right with selection
* [ ] Navigate to end and start of line (no md line, but preview line)
* [ ] Navigate to end and start of line with selection
* [ ] Delete line
* [ ] Delete line left and right from cursor
* [ ] Extend selection (selects word left and right and extends the more you press, similar to how Intellij works)

* [ ] Navigate up and down, open and close directories in sidebar
* [ ] Add a setting to adjust repeat delays for each shortcut
* [ ] Navigate to next and previous heading
