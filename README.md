# Obsidian Document Editing Shortcuts

This plugin tries to take basic document editing shortcuts as well as advanced IDE's and implements those in Obsidian.

It's an ongoing project, so expect more polish and shortcuts added in the future. Feel free to contribute or make requests, even if what you need is already in the todo list, it will help prioritise what to work on and add first.

## Shortcuts

All shortcuts will `repeat` if you hold the buttons you mapped to perform them.
Here's what's completed and needs to be done

### Done
* [x] Navigate one character right and left
* [x] Navigate one word right and left
* [x] Delete one character right and left
* [x] Delete one word right and left
* [x] Navigate up and down
* [x] Add new line (Enter)
* [x] Start new line (this creates a new line below the cursor and navigates there without splitting)

### Todo
* [ ] Navigate up down left right with selection
* [ ] Navigate one word left and right with selection
* [ ] Navigate to end and start of line (not the markdown line, the normal line)
* [ ] Navigate to end and start of line with selection
* [ ] Delete line
* [ ] Delete line left and right from cursor
* [ ] Extend selection (selects word left and right and extends the more you press, similar to how Intellij works)
* [ ] Expand and collapse file explorer
* [ ] Navigate up and down, open and close directories in file explorer
* [ ] Add a setting to adjust repeat delays for each shortcut
* [ ] Navigate to next and previous heading
* [ ] Navigate a defined (in settings) amount of lines up and down
* [ ] All document navigation settings for line up and down should have a companion shortcut to scroll with the cursor
* [ ] Scroll up and down
* [ ] Center scroll relative to cursor
* [ ] More to be added ...
